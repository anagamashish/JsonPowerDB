### Conclusion

      *Technology,Cost and Speed Matters*

If a query runs 10 times faster on a new technology database, theoretically it should reduce the cost of infrastructure by 10 times. Practically, may be 7 to 9 times or may be more, and its considerable cost saving. (7 to 9 systems with a load balancer may get reduced to just one system handling the same workload).

Market will always welcome such new technology with improved performance and efficiency and with considerably reduced the cost of ownership.
